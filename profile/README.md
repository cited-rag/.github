# Cited RAG
GPT that gets you the right data from your trusted sources.

### About the project

Truth on the internet is obscure and topics often have a publisher bias.

As LLMs learn from all the data on the internet its hard for them to know fact from fiction. LLM also often have a query bias where the sentiment of the answer depends on the sentiment of the query itself.

With Cited RAG, we wanted a way to make sure our users will be able to query sources they trust and know where they are getting their information from.
